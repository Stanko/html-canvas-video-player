		<h1>Depreciation notice</h1>

		<p>
			This was intended for auto-playing videos on iOS, but as of iOS 10, there is native supported option <code>playsinline</code>, read more here: 
			<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/">
				https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/ 
			</a>
			(Android works for ages now). 
		</p>
		<p>
			So this project is not actively maintained anymore. Use native HTML video instead of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If anyone wants to take over the maintenance, feel free to open an issue, and I'll add you as contributor.
		</p>

			
		<h1 class="margin-bottom-10">HTML canvas video player</h1>
		<h3 class="margin-bottom-20">Easy way to play videos inline on iPhones</h3>
		<p>
			This is intended for iPhone only, it can be used on any other browser
			which support canvas and video. <strike>It doesn't play sound, I have no real
			plan of adding audio support.</strike>
		</p>
		<p>
			Audio is now supported. Autoplay on iOS is NOT working with
			audio (autoplay is disabled in that case).
		</p>
		<p>
			It can be used with any HTML video player, just position canvas over the video.
			Intended usage was for background videos and showcases.
			Still, if you can, use regular HTML5 video, this was intended to use only on iPhones.
			This is plain JavaScript solution, no dependencies, IE9+ and modern browsers.
		</p>

		<p>
			For IE9 there must be <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> polyfill.
			Audio is not tested on IE9.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please let me know if you are using this player, I would like to make a small showcase, thanks!
		</p>

		<h5>Known issues</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				It is very buggy and sometimes doesn't work at all on Android.
				I don't have plans for fixing this, if someone has idea, please issue a pull request.
				Just use regular HTML5 video.
			</li>

	* ready - happens after drawing first frame on video (this happens on initialization). Data passed to callbacks is { width: pixels, height: pixels, duration: float seconds }
	* progress - happens after new frame is drawed. Data is current video progress (float seconds)
	* cuepoint - happens at time positions passed in "cuepoints" option or set via setCuepoints method. Data passed is { "time": cuepoint_value, "index": cuepoint_index }
	* finish - happens after video is ended. No data is passed.
